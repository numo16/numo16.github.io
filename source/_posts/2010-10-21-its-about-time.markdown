So after putting off starting this blog for quite a while now, I’ve decided it is time to do this. I guess the main reason I never really did anything with it before was lack of motivation. I kept asking myself what I would write about or why should I take time out of my increasingly busy schedule to write a bit of drivel, here and there. Well, I’ve been pushing myself into game programming a bit more lately after taking an XNA class and loving it, and decided it’s time I start chronicling my progress and interesting things I run across.

Lately, I’ve been reading a lot of the stuff over on [Game Development Stack Exchange](http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/) in order to figure out where to start when it comes to game development in C++.  I’ll start out by saying, I haven’t used C++ in a long time, as I’ve been developing in PHP at work and my latest programming classes have been C# and VB.Net.  So, a refresher was in order, along with figuring out where to start.  So, I found SDL and started tearing through some game dev specific tutorials and I must say, C++ is coming back to me pretty well.  In addition to the SDL tutorials, I’ve been watching the C++ videos over on [3D Buzz](http://www.3dbuzz.com/), which have also been an immense help in refreshing my knowledge of the language, as well as, helping me to figure out the overall structure of putting a game together from scratch. So far, everything has been great with refreshing and learning.

Although learning C++ game dev has been great and a nice challenge, so far, I may find myself jumping back into XNA for a while.  I got a newsletter yesterday reminding me about the [Imagine Cup 2011](http://www.imaginecup.us/) competition that Microsoft is putting on.  I took a look through the game design category and decided it looked like something doable, if I were able to get the right group of creative minds together for my team.  I read through the theme and came up with a couple decent ideas right away that I will play around with a bit.  After some mind-mapping and discussion with my probable team members last night, I have a few better ideas that just may work out.  Stay tuned…
