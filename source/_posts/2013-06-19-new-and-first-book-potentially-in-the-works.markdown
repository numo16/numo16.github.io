You read that right, I may be writing a book. A major publisher of books for the tech crowd has approached me to ask if I would be interested in authoring a short book on programming using specific technologies (more info as I find out what exactly I am allowed to say). Needless to say, I am excited for the opportunity and a bit terrified, as I haven’t really done a large writing project in a long time…Especially not one that will be published through a major publisher.

All that being said, I am very excited about the prospect and I intend on chronicling my experiences during the process here, as I am able. This should be a fun and exciting challenge. Stay tuned!
